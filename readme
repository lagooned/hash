# Date Hash Table #

This program implements a hash table which uses a hashing function of my design
and quadratic probing to store date-name pairs. The main function then asks for
a date, and proceeds to find it in the array in very low complexity time. The
data is also always held in an array of prime size and is it's size is prime as
to reduce hashing collisions.
