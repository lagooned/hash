# Date Hash Table #

This program implements a hash table which uses a hashing function of my design
and quadratic probing to store date-name pairs. The main function then asks for
a date, and proceeds to find it in the array in low-complexity time. The data is
also always held in an array of prime size as to reduce hashing collisions.
